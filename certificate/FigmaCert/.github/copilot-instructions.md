- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created.
- [x] Clarify Project Requirements.
- [x] Scaffold the Project.
- [x] Customize the Project.
- [x] Install Required Extensions (none required).
- [x] Compile the Project (run lint/build as needed).
- [x] Implement full functionality for GenerateCertificate component.
- [ ] Create and Run Task (only if a VS Code task is required).
- [ ] Launch the Project (ask before starting debug/serve).
- [ ] Ensure Documentation is Complete (README and this file stay current).

Execution Guidelines:
- Use '.' as the working directory; avoid new folders except .vscode for tasks.
- Keep updates concise; note skipped steps explicitly.
- Use placeholders only with a note to replace later.
- Task complete when scaffolding, docs, and this checklist reflect the current state.
